You can insert inline elements inside block elements. For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element.
Inline elements cannot contain any block level elements.

TML forms are used to collect information from the user.
Forms are defined using the <form> element, with its opening and closing tags:
<body>
   <form>â€¦</form>
</body>

Use the action attribute to point to a webpage that will load after the user submits the form.
<form action="http://www.sololearn.com"> 
</form>








The method and name Attributes

The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when forms are submitted (see below for description):
<form action="url" method="GET">

<form action="url" method="POST">

When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address.

Use POST if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (passwords).
POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.

To take in user input, you need the corresponding form elements, such as text fields. The <input> element has many variations, depending on the type attribute. It can be a text, password, radio, URL, submit, etc. 

The example below shows a form requesting a username and password:
<form>
   <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
   <input type="password" name="password" />
</form>



If we change the input type to radio, it allows the user select only one of a number of choices:
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" /> Male <br />
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="female" /> Female <br />




The type "checkbox" allows the user to select more than one option:
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="1" /> Male <br />
<input type="checkbox" name="gender" value="2" /> Female <br />

The submit button submits a form to its action attribute:
<input type="submit" value="Submit" /> 


Colors are displayed in combinations of red, green, and blue light (RGB).

Hex values are written using the hashtag symbol (#), followed by either three or six hex characters.
As shown in the picture below, the circles overlap, forming new colors:


RGB color values are supported in all browsers.



The <frame> Tag

A page can be divided into frames using a special frame document. 

The <frame> tag defines one specific window (frame) within a <frameset>. Each <frame> in a <frameset> can have different attributes, such as border, scrolling, the ability to resize, etc. 

The <frameset> element specifies the number of columns or rows in the frameset, as well as what percentage or number of pixels of space each of them occupies.
<frameset cols="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
<frameset rows="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
